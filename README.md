Minor discrepancies between the results produced in the code and those in the report arise from differences in random seed initialization, as the exact seed used in the original experiments could not be identified. While just before the deadline I noticed something didnt match up which looked like something non deterministic had happend and tried finding were it came from but in the procces the seeding settings got lost
